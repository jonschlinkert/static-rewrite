## What does this do?

This module does something similar to [URL rewriting](#url-rewriting), but for static paths at build-time. The goal is to consistently and easily generate correct destination paths during development, regardless of the source paths.

**Examples**

Let's say we have a blog, with post titled "How To Create Effective Permalinks", and we want to:

- automatically write the post to the root of our site
- use the slugified `title` from front-matter as the folder name (for "pretty" permalinks)
- append `/index.html` to the path (also for "pretty" permalinks)

In other words, we want this source path:

```
src/content/posts/2017-02-14.md
```

To be written to a destination path that looks something like:

```
blog/how-to-create-effective-permalinks/index.html
```

You can either manually parse and reformat your destination paths, or use this library with simple rewrite rules. 

**Example rewrite rule**

The following rule(s) will match any files in the `posts` directory, and rewrite the path using the given [structure](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/permalinks#structure).

```js
rewriter.rule(/posts\//, 'blog/:slugify(title)/index.html');
// add extra validation if necessary
rewriter.rule(/posts\//, 'blog/:slugify(title)/index.html', function(file) {
  return file.extname === '.md';
});
```

<summary><strong>URL rewriting</strong></summary>
URL rewriting is used for replacing semantic, user-friendly URLs with server-friendly URLs.

For example, when a user enters a URL like the following to go to a page on wikipedia:

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business
```

The URL might be rewritten by wikipedia to something like:

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business
```
</details>


## Usage
Add this library to your JavaScript application with the following line of code:

```js
var Rewriter = require('{%= name %}');
```
