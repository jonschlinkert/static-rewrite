## What does this do?

Typically, URL rewriting is used for replacing semantic, user-friendly URLs with server-friendly URLs.

For example, when a user enters a URL like the following to go to a page on wikipedia:

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business
```

The URL might be rewritten by wikipedia to something like:

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business
```

### Static rewriting

This module does something similar, but for static paths at build-time.

**Example**

```js

```

```
